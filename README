################################################

#This is a directory in which I intend to try to build  a package which:

1)Runs NCV
-this requires:
-input data (file in modified VCF format)
-human-FD bed file
-sge script for parallelizing
-OR, parallelizing option without sge script.


#This part is done.
#Note: although NCV can be run withour parallelizing, that takes quite some time. If you have a cluster or a supercomputer, it is best to use it.
#If you use a SGE for job submission, run
./run_NCV_sge.sh

#Important: if you use this option, make sure you go to the file which ends with .sge in the scripts folder and edit it according to your usual SGE settings.
#These scripts are optimized to run NCV in ~900 parallel jobs at the MPI-MPG in Leipzig.

############################
#If you don't use SGE or anything of the sort, but are using a linux machine (of course), run

./run_NCV.sh

#this will parallelize the jobs using 'GNU parallel'. It is not a very clever solution, but it works nevertheless.


2) Reads in NCV results, includes window coverage data




3) Corrects NCV values with 10,000 sims for bins of Inf. Sites





4) Makes the function find.genes and provides possibilities for the user to
query NCV results with this function


#This will be a lot of work, but I will try.
