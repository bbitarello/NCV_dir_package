#This is a directory in which I intend to try to build  a package which:

1)Runs NCV
-this requires:
-input data (file in modified VCF format)
-human-FD bed file
-sge script for parallelizing
-OR, parallelizing option without sge script.



2) Reads in NCV results, includes window coverage data


3) Corrects NCV values with 10,000 sims for bins of Inf. Sites


4) Makes the function find.genes and provides possibilities for the user to
query NCV results with this function


#This will be a lot of work, but I will try.
